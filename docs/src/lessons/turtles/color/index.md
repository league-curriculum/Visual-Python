Tina can change into lots of colors!  We can tell her to change into blue by typing `tina.color("blue")`.

Each color segment in the picture is created by three lines of code:

```python
tina.forward(20)
tina.color("blue")
tina.write("What color am I now?")
```

Add two more colors to her list by adding another three lines like this but with `"blue"` replaced with your favorite color.  `"pink"`? `"yellow"`? `"cyan"`?  It's up to you.
