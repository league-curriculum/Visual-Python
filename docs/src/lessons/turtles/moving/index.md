title: Moving

---


As we saw in the last example, Tina can move!  When she moves, she draws a line.  She can move `forward` and `backward` and turn `right` or `left` a certain number of degrees.

Run this example to see her move:
 
<iframe width="100%" height="800" src="https://trinket.io/tools/1.0/jekyll/embed/python#code=import%20turtle%0Atina%20%3D%20turtle.Turtle%28%29%0Atina.shape%28%22turtle%22%29%0A%0Atina.forward%2850%29%0Atina.left%2890%29%0Atina.forward%2850%29%0Atina.left%2890%29%0Atina.forward%2850%29" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

She's almost made a square!  Can you help her complete it?  What other shapes can you help Tina draw?
