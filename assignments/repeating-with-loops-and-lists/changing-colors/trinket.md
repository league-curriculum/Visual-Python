We can loop over a list of colors and tell Tina to turn that color.

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/107875423?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="600" height="337" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> 

Run this program, and see where the colors come from.  What happens if you add or remove colors from the list?

{{ trinket("changing-colors_1.py", width="100%", height="800", embed_type="python") | safe }}

Want to make this program your own?  Change what tina does inside the `for` loop.  What else could she do for each color?
