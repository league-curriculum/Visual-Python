Until now, we've had to write out numbers every time we want Tina to move.  We can use a list of numbers and a loop to get her to move many times!

{{ trinket("lists-of-numbers_1.py", width="100%", height="800", embed_type="python") | safe }}

The code `number_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` is where Tina gets her numbers from.  Can you change the numbers in the list to change how she moves?  Make sure that your list starts and ends with square brackets (`[]`), and has a comma (`,`) in between every number.
