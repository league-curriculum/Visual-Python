Turtles can determine whether a number is above or below another number.  Let's write a program that asks how old you are:

{{ trinket("tina-asks-how-old-you-are_1.py", width="100%", height="800", embed_type="python") | safe }}

**Advanced:** In the example above you'll see there are `try:` and `except:`.  These lines try to run code that comes after `try:`, and if any errors happen, do what's in the `except:` section.  This is how Tina knows whether you put in a real number like `15`.  This is how real programmers change the behavior of programs based on any errors that might come up.
