Not only can we rename Turtles: we can have more than one!  Let's give Tina a friend named Tommy:

{{ trinket("tina-and-tommys-colors_1.py", width="100%", height="800", embed_type="python") | safe }}

Tina and Tommy are both drawing in `black`.  Can you modify the code `tina.color('black')` and `tommy.color('black')` so that they're different colors?  Need a color idea?  Try an unusal one like `'goldenrod'` or `'magenta'`.  Don't forget the **quotes** (`'`)!
