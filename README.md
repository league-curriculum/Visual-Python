# Introduction to Python With Trinket

This repo is a mirror of the Trinket Course[Introduction to Python Programming]
(https://trinket.io/eric-busboom/courses/introduction-to-python-programming), 
which is a copy of a course provided by Trinket. We've modified the course
to include some recipes. 

The course should be modified online, then to back it up, mirror it to 
this repo. First, download the course from Course>>Download Course Pages. 
Unpack the zip file, then run:


```
rsync -rva <downloaddir>/Trinket Course-introduction-to-python-programming-md/  md-source/
```

Note that the directories in the rsync command bith have trailing slashes; 
they are important!

The ``course.yaml`` file is a nacent configuration; currenty it just lists the
order of the directories for the online course.
